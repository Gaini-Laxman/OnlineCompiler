- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

## Downloading OnlineCompiler

There are several ways you can get the OnlineCompiler:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get OnlineCompiler is to use git to directly clone the OnlineCompiler repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Gaini-Laxman/OnlineCompiler
```

This will clone the latest version of the OnlineCompiler repository to a **OnlineCompiler** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the OnlineCompiler boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/Gaini-Laxman/codOnlineCompilergrep/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

## Quick Install

To install the dependencies, run this in both client and backend folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

&#8594; server start

```bash
$ cd backend
$ node server
```

&#8594; client start

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

- Your client application should run on port 3000 with the _development_ environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- Your server application should run on port 8000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000)
